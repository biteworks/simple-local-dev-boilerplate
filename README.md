# Simple local dev boilerplate
## Description

To quickly test ideas I created a small, simple boilerplate that contains an http server and the basic folder structure. So that one can also create new projects faster, the repo is created as a template.

## Usage 

There are two ways to use the boilerplate:

* **As a template in GitHub**
* **As a cloned repository**

### Steps "As a template in GitHub"

1. Click on *"Use this template"* on the github repo site.
2. Fill in all the fields *"Repository name"* and *"Description (optional)"* and decide if the repo should be public or private.
3. Click on *"Create repository from template"* to create the repo.
4. Clone the new repo afterwards

### Steps "As a cloned repository"

1. Clone the repo - what a easy step ðŸ˜‰

### Local steps to use the template

1. Open the folder in the terminal
2. Run ```npm install```
3. To start the server run ```npm run dev```
4. Now you can develop within the public folder and have fun ðŸŽ‰
